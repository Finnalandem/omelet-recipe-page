## My process

I started with the base HTML that came with the starter files, then started adding the tags and elements that suit the situation best. After completing the HTML, I moved over to the CSS file, and just went from top to bottom of the HTML, styling as I went.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to continue learning web development to eventually be capable of developing full stack applications all on my own.

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript.info](https://www.javascript.info) - This helped me with certain HTML aspects that I hadn't seen or used before in prior projects.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with table styling as I've never done much styling with tables in the past.
